# PHP Array Key Overwrite Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common bug in PHP related to array key overwriting when using `array_merge()` and `array_combine()`.  If arrays with duplicate keys are merged or combined, the later key's value silently overwrites the earlier one, potentially leading to unexpected data loss.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` illustrates how to prevent this by using more appropriate techniques, such as checking for duplicate keys before merging or using `array_replace()` which handles this behaviour differently.  Read the file comments for more details.

This example highlights the importance of thorough understanding of PHP's array functions and paying attention to potential key collisions.  Always carefully consider your key management to ensure data integrity.
