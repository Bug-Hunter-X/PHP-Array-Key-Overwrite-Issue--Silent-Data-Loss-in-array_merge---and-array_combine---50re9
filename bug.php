In PHP, a common yet easily overlooked error involves improper handling of array keys when using array functions like `array_merge()` or `array_combine()`.  If you merge arrays with duplicate keys, the later key's value will overwrite the previous one, leading to data loss. Consider this example:

```php
$array1 = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$array2 = ['b' => 3, 'c' => 4];
$merged = array_merge($array1, $array2);
print_r($merged); // Output: Array ( [a] => 1 [b] => 3 [c] => 4 )
```

Notice how the value of 'b' from `$array1` is lost.  A less obvious case occurs with `array_combine()` when the keys array contains duplicates. Only the values corresponding to the last occurrence of each key are retained. This makes debugging difficult if you are not aware of this behavior.
